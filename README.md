# Different Implementations of classes in Javascript

This project utilize the 3 implementations of classes that are used most in the Javascript. It includes "functions as classes", "class via 'class' keyword" and 'Inheritance in class'. 

Classes are not straightforward in Javascript as they are in other object oriented languages like Java, C++. Infact class is design pattern in Javascript and in actual classes concept don't exists in Javascript. This code will act as boilerplate to start working with the classes wherever required.
